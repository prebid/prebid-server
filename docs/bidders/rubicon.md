# Rubicon Bidder

Please contact your Rubicon Project account manager to get set up with a login and cookie-sync URL to run your own Prebid Server. You will be given instructions, including the available endpoints.

**Note:** Rubicon is disabled by default. Please enable it in the app config if you wish to use it. Make sure you provide the correct cookie-sync URL in order for cookie-syncs to work properly.

[Rubicon Project Prebid.js test parameters](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/modules/rubiconBidAdapter.md) will work for server as well.
