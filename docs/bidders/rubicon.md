# Rubicon Bidder

Please contact [Rubicon Project](../../static/bidder-info/rubicon.yaml) to get set up with a login and cookie-sync URL to run your own Prebid Server.

You will be given instructions, including the available endpoints.

**Note:** Rubicon is disabled by default. Please enable it in the app config if you wish to use it. Make sure you provide the correct cookie-sync URL in order for cookie-syncs to work properly.
