post-stop script

# prevent rapid restarts of the application
# It doesn't help that there is a post-stop script in the master template
# because if this process dies it is respawned having nothing to do with
# the master upstart config.

# this sleep is tied to the amount of time that v1.go will 503 after receiving a SIGHUP / SIGINT / SIGTERM
# if we start up before the previous process closes the socket, the socket gets closed while the new process is attepting
# to bind to it, and we fail to create the socket.
sleep 5
