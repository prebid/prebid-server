# when a changed file paths matches the regex, send an alert email
# structure of the file is:
#
# javascriptRegex : email address
#
# For example, in PBS Go, there are many paths that can belong to bid adapter:
#
# /adapters/BIDDERCODE
# /openrtb_ext/imp_BIDDERCODE.go
# /static/bidder-params/BIDDERCODE.json
# /static/bidder-info/BIDDERCODE.yaml
#
# The aim is to find a minimal set of regex patterns that matches any file in these paths
