# Implementation Comparison: Original PR #4279 vs. New Implementation

## Overview

This document compares the original mutations-in-sequence implementation (PR #4279, branch: `mutations-in-sequence`) with the new clean-room implementation (branch: `sequential-mutations-implementation`).

Both implementations solve the same core problem: **ensuring mutations are applied in the order hooks are listed in config**, not in the order hooks complete execution.

---

## Core Strategy (Identical)

Both implementations use the same fundamental approach:
1. **Pre-allocate a slice** of `hookResponse[P]` with fixed size = `len(group.Hooks)`
2. **Each goroutine writes to its designated index** (matches config order)
3. **After WaitGroup completes**, responses are in deterministic config order
4. **Mutations applied sequentially** in that predictable order

---

## Key Similarities

| Aspect | Both Implementations |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Core Pattern** | Pre-allocated slice + indexed writes |
| **Synchronization** | `sync.WaitGroup` for goroutine completion |
| **Rejection Signaling** | Channel with `sync.Once` for safe closure |
| **Function Signature Change** | `executeHook` returns `bool` + writes to pointer |
| **Remove collectHookResponses** | ✅ Removed (no longer needed) |
| **Pass payload as parameter** | ✅ Avoid closure capture issues |

---

## Key Differences

### 1. **Context Management**

**Original PR #4279:**
```go
go func() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
    defer cancel()
    result, err := hookHandler(ctx, moduleCtx, hw.Hook, payload)
    hookRespCh <- hookResponse[P]{
        Result: result,
        Err:    err,
    }
}()
```
- Context created **inside** child goroutine
- Parent cannot cancel child on timeout/rejection
- **Goroutine leak issue**: Child continues executing after parent times out

**New Implementation:**
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
defer cancel() // Parent can cancel child

go func() {
    result, err := hookHandler(ctx, moduleCtx, hw.Hook, payload)
    // Respect context cancellation when sending
    select {
    case hookRespCh <- hookResponse[P]{...}:
    case <-ctx.Done():
        // Context canceled, don't send result
    }
}()
```
- Context created at **parent level**
- Parent can cancel child via `defer cancel()`
- **No goroutine leak**: Child respects context cancellation

**Impact:** The new implementation properly stops hook execution on timeout/rejection, saving CPU and memory.

---

### 2. **Timeout Detection**

**Original PR #4279:**
```go
select {
case res := <-hookRespCh:
    *resp = res
    return res.Result.Reject
case <-time.After(timeout):
    *resp = hookResponse[P]{
        Err: TimeoutError{},
        ...
    }
    return false
case <-rejected:
    return false
}
```
- Uses `time.After(timeout)`
- **Timer leak issue**: Timer continues until it fires, even after hook completes
- Redundant with context timeout

**New Implementation:**
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
defer cancel()

select {
case res := <-hookRespCh:
    *resp = res
    return res.Result.Reject
case <-ctx.Done():  // Use context for timeout
    *resp = hookResponse[P]{
        Err: TimeoutError{},
        ...
    }
    return false
case <-rejected:
    *resp = hookResponse[P]{...}
    return false
}
```
- Uses `ctx.Done()` for timeout detection
- **No timer leak**: Context handles timeout internally
- Simpler: One timeout mechanism instead of two

**Impact:** The new implementation is cleaner and avoids timer leaks. As the user astutely observed: "Why manage a separate timer when the context already has timeout?"

---

### 3. **Rejected Case Handling**

**Original PR #4279:**
```go
case <-rejected:
    // In this path, rejected has already been reported; no need to report it again.
    return false
```
- **Bug**: `resp` pointer is never written to
- Leaves zero-value `hookResponse` in array
- `handleHookResponses` processes uninitialized response

**New Implementation:**
```go
case <-rejected:
    // Another hook rejected; record cancellation response
    // This ensures the response is properly initialized rather than left as zero-value
    *resp = hookResponse[P]{
        HookID:        hookId,
        ExecutionTime: time.Since(startTime),
        Result:        hookstage.HookResult[P]{},
    }
    return false
```
- **Fix**: Always initializes response pointer
- Prevents zero-value bugs downstream
- Paired with zero-value check in `handleHookResponses`

**Impact:** The new implementation prevents potential nil pointer dereferences and map corruption from empty HookID strings.

---

### 4. **Zero-Value Response Handling**

**Original PR #4279:**
```go
func handleHookResponses[P any](...) {
    for _, r := range hookResponses {
        groupModuleCtx[r.HookID.ModuleCode] = r.Result.ModuleContext
        // ... process response
    }
}
```
- No zero-value check
- Processes all responses, including uninitialized ones
- Empty `HookID.ModuleCode` creates map entry with empty key

**New Implementation:**
```go
func handleHookResponses[P any](...) {
    for _, r := range hookResponses {
        // Skip responses from hooks that were canceled
        if r.HookID.ModuleCode == "" {
            continue
        }
        groupModuleCtx[r.HookID.ModuleCode] = r.Result.ModuleContext
        // ... process response
    }
}
```
- Explicitly skips zero-value responses
- Prevents processing uninitialized data
- Cleaner separation of completed vs. canceled hooks

**Impact:** More robust error handling and cleaner semantics.

---

### 5. **Documentation**

**Original PR #4279:**
- Minimal inline comments
- No function-level documentation
- Behavior changes not documented

**New Implementation:**
- Comprehensive function documentation
- Explains resource cleanup guarantees
- Documents cancellation behavior
- Inline comments explain non-obvious decisions

**Example:**
```go
// executeHook executes a single hook and writes the response to the provided pointer.
// Returns true if the hook rejected the request, false otherwise.
//
// The function ensures proper resource cleanup by:
//   - Using a cancellable context that stops the hook handler on timeout or early exit
//   - Relying on context.Done() for timeout detection (no separate timer needed)
//   - Always initializing the response pointer, even when canceled
//
// When another hook signals rejection via the rejected channel, this hook stops
// execution and records a cancellation response.
func executeHook[H any, P any](...) bool {
```

---

### 6. **Variable Naming**

**Original PR #4279:**
```go
newPayload := handleModuleActivities(...)
go func(hw hooks.HookWrapper[H], hookResp *hookResponse[P], moduleCtx...) {
    executeHook(moduleCtx, hw, newPayload, ...)
}(hook, &hookResponses[i], mCtx)
```
- Uses `newPayload` (captured by closure - potential race)
- Passed `newPayload` from outer scope

**New Implementation:**
```go
hookPayload := handleModuleActivities(...)
go func(index int, hw hooks.HookWrapper[H], moduleCtx..., payload P) {
    executeHook(moduleCtx, hw, payload, ...)
}(i, hook, mCtx, hookPayload)
```
- Uses `hookPayload` (clearer intent)
- **Passed as goroutine parameter** (explicit, no closure capture)
- Avoids potential data race

## User Feedback Incorporated

During implementation, the user provided a critical insight:

> "I see that there is use of Timer - but we also have moved the context.WithTimeout to the outer scope; can we merely check ctx.Done instead of needing yet another timer to manage?"

**Response:** Absolutely correct! The new implementation simplifies by using `ctx.Done()` instead of managing a separate `time.NewTimer`. This eliminates:
- Timer leak concerns
- Need for explicit `timer.Stop()` calls
- Redundant timeout mechanisms
- Additional complexity

This demonstrates the value of fresh-eyes code review and clean-room implementation.
